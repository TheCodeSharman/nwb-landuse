name=Upstream Landuse Calculator
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Calculates land use statistics upstream from a given set of points.
version=0.1
author=The Code Sharman
email=michael@thecodesharman.com.au

about=Calculates upstream landuse use statistics from a given points layer using the CFEV river section catchment network and the Land use of Australia data set. This can be used to identify land use changes upstream from a given point. Limitations: The point used for assesment is moved to the bottom of the nearest river section catchment polygon, so this may include a small amount of downstream landuse in the calculations.
