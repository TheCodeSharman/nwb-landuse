1. create a predictive model to predict delta signal score.
2. inputs are every possible delta, the landuse deltas create from the same time difference
3. add time interval as column - and start (or end) time
4. catchment area
5. longitude and latitude
5. singal score vs signal score _1 do both
4. have signal score versus land use percentages as a seperate data set too.
5. fix mapping of dates so that old site samples are ignored
6. fix mapping of dates more appropriately (not via latest date of layer)
